# Simon-s-Game

### Overview
This mini-project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, where players must memorize and replicate sequences of colors generated by the computer. Each level introduces a new color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as the game progresses. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How the Game Works
- **Starting the Game:** The game starts when the player presses any key. This triggers the first level, where a random color in the sequence is displayed.
- **Gameplay:** 
  - The player must click the buttons in the exact order as displayed by the game.
  - After each correct sequence, the game advances to the next level, adding an additional color to the sequence.
- **Winning and Losing:**
  - If the player clicks the buttons in the correct order, the game continues to the next level.
  - If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the player is informed of their final score. The highest score achieved is also displayed.

### Code Structure
- **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the game, including the buttons representing the colors and the headers that display the level and high score.
- **CSS:** Styles the game elements, including the buttons, background, and flashing animations.
- **JavaScript:** Manages the game logic, including sequence generation, user interaction, level progression, and game resetting.

### Key JavaScript Functions
- **`levelUp()`:** Advances the game to the next level by adding a new random color to the sequence and updating the display.
- **`checkAns(idx)`:** Compares the player's input sequence with the game sequence to determine if the input is correct. If the sequence is correct, the game proceeds to the next level; if not, the game ends.
- **`btnFlash(btn)` and `userFlash(btn)`:** Handle the visual feedback for the buttons when they are activated by the game or clicked by the player.
- **`reset()`:** Resets the game state, allowing the player to start over.

### Features
- **Responsive Design:** The game buttons are sized and spaced to provide an easy and enjoyable user experience on different devices.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons flash when selected by the game and when clicked by the user, providing clear visual cues.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the current level and the highest level achieved, displaying these to the player.

### How to Play
1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch the sequence of flashing buttons.
4. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
5. Continue to higher levels as long as you input the correct sequence.
6. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score is displayed. Press any key to restart.
